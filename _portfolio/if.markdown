In high school, I went to **CTI-Unesp**, a vocation school where I studied Informatics. My final year project was a fluxogram interpreter called IF, and our "company" was called Else. We wrote weekly posts [on our blog](https://elsecti.wordpress.com/) for the entire year, which now I realize was very useful.

All of us spent one semester creating fluxograms by hand -- and our teachers, correcting them! Our aim building this tool was to help learning and teaching programming logic, making it more fun, and giving faster feedback to students and teachers.
