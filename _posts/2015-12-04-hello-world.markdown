Hello there!

I created this website mostly to have an <a href="/about">about me</a> page.

It's also handy to have a place set up for those moments when I think "oh, I could write about that".

I get a lot of help from blog posts whenever I'm coding, so I'd like to give back a bit, even if the contribution starts small.

I'll also make a Portuguese translation of all this soon. Maybe I'll even try a Spanish one to practice! :)

I won't add comments any soon, but if you feel like reaching out to me, don't hesitate and <a href="mailto:gabrielascardine@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.
